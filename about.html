                <h1>Hi, I'm Tatum</h1>
                <p>
                    It's great to have you here! I'm a digital creator with proficiency in 2D art, animation, design, and
                    direction, who will be graduating from Boise State University with a
                    Bachelor of Science in Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile Technology (GIMM) in May 2025.
                </p>
                <p>Ever since I was little, I've been a creative; from spending hours at the kitchen table with my brother
                    drawing Pokémon to using a mouse to draw in MS Paint on my family computer,
                    art has always been a part of my life. I was self taught up until college, where I studied as an
                    Illustration major for a year and continued my studies in GIMM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently the Art Director of GIMM Work's Student Development Team, and have been since January
                    2024. Through my time here, I've had the privilege of working alongside a
                    fantastic group of creators on projects that are impactful, imaginative, and one-of-a-kind for folks
                    across the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having the opportunity to create and collaborate with other passionate and inspired minds has been such
                    an honor, and I'm looking forward to seeing what new roads await me.
