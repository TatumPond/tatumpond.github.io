                <p>
                    This project was my first on GIMM Works, and I was given full freedom to create the art direction
                    for a JRPG
                    for Brycen Wiscombe, a 14 year old boy with Leukemia for his Make-a-Wish. I've been working on this
                    project for nearly
                    a year now, and is still in development. This has been not only a fantastic learning experience for
                    me, but also has been
                    incredibly rewarding to work on. This project was the first time I saw the impact my team and I make
                    with our work, and I'm
                    so excited to continue working on it.

                    This is my first prototype of my individual immersive game, which is planned to be completed in
                    the
                    spring of 2025. This is
                    a VR game created using Unity, the Oculus Quest 2, Maya, and various other programs. I started
                    prototyping it in the spring of
                    2023, so this is the longest project I've done/will done to date. The premise of the game is a
                    loose
                    story game where you play
                    as a rat who has to collect food throughout a large, open map where you can defeat enemies and
                    solve
                    puzzles. This prototype
                    contains a lot of the main mechanics, but all of the assets at the moment are either UNity asset
                    store products, or built using
                    Unity's ProBuilder. By the end of this project, nearly everything will be created by me.
