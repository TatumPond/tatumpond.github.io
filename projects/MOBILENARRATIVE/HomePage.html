    <div class="container">For my webpage, I chose to do research on the Nintendo Pokemon games that began in 1996 and
        are still continuing today.
        These games are probably my most favorite and have a really special place in my heart as the first video games I
        fell in love with.
        The Pokemon franchise as a whole is something that I've always really enjoyed, and these games are full of data
        that I could pull from
        to make my project interesting. My research only includes the main series games, meaning side games like
        Colosseum, Stadium, and GO are
        not included.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
        I contemplated at first to focus on all of the Pokemon in the franchise and use data on their stats, types,
        generation they were
        introduced, ect, but I figured I'd find a lot more information if I looked at the stats of the games themselves.
        This included game
        data such as how many Pokemon were in each game, how many items, the region it takes place in, the generation,
        and many other stats.
        I also wanted to look into the release dates of each game and what platforms they are available on. This route
        gave me a plethora of
        solid information to choose from, and I found that I had much more than I actually needed, which I consider to
        be a good problem to have.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
        The main resources that I used to collect this information were Bulbapedia and Serebii.net, two sites that are
        made specifically for
        information on the Pokemon games and franchise. Nearly all the information I collected I was able to find on
        either of these websites,
        and it made my life a lot easier when I started organizing my data. I also found some forums on Reddit and other
        similar sites for
        specifics, such as how many Pokemon you're able to catch in each game.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
        Through my research, I drew a lot of conclusions, some more obvious than others. A pretty apparent one is how
        with each generation, the
        number of Pokemon, items, and abilities became greater. I found it interesting that within a generation, where 3
        to 6 games are introduced,
        only Generation 8 introduced more Pokemon in the middle of the generation. I also found it interesting that once
        Generation 7 began, HM's
        (Hidden Machines) were removed from the games, and never made another appearance. There are many other things I
        discovered through my
        research, but the main takeaway is that I discovered a lot of trends within the data that were very interesting
        and gave me more insight
        into the nitty gritty of these games.
