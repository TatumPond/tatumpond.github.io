                    Progress of a concept piece I'm working on for a client project for GIMM 480 (Senior Capstone). This project
                    is all about world building and creating a cohesive environment and story for a future game. My task is to create what
                    the "mushroom gorge" would look like. I'm creating this piece deliberatly and am focusing on use of color and detail.

                    Background image for a personal project I was working on in the fall of 2023. I ended up having to abandon the project
                    due lost interest and time constraints, but it's still a piece I'm proud of.

                    Sketchy piece I created as a gift. Sketching is my favorite part of my process, as I enjoy how loose I can be with my lines
                    and how forgiving it is, and taking sketches and making them very detailed is even better. I would love to render this at 
                    some point, but for now I'm happy with how it stands.

                    Redesign of my logo I created back in 2019 for my mom's flower business, Whoopsie Daisy Floral. I wanted to update it with fresher
                    lines, colors, and wording, and I gave it to her as a Christmas gift. It's featured on her instagram, buisness cards, and stock
                    cards placed in her bouquets.

                    Piece I created as a gift for a friend's birthday. I wanted to try some water techniques and a semi-lineless style, and I'm overall
                    happy with the result. The sharks featured are a great white, hammerhead, whale shark, leopard shark, and nurse shark.

                <p>
                    This project was done for GIMM 200, an animation and UX class. The final for
                    the course was a UX design and wireframe project where we designed a potential app. My app and wireframe was 
                    on a book I wrote and illustrated when I was in 1st grade. I redrew and rewrote the story for this project, and it
                    was so much fun to breathe new life into something creative I did as a kid .
