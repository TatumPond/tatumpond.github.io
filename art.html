                    Progress of a concept piece I'm working on for a client project for GIMM 480 (Senior Capstone). This project
                    is all about world building and creating a cohesive environment and story for a future game. My task is to create what
                    the "mushroom gorge" would look like. I'm creating this piece deliberatly and am focusing on use of color and detail.

                    due lost interest and time constraints, but it's still a piece I'm proud of.

                    Sketchy piece I created as a gift. Sketching is my favorite part of my process, as I enjoy how loose I can be with my lines
                    and how forgiving it is, and taking sketches and making them very detailed is even better. I would love to render this at 
                    some point, but for now I'm happy with how it stands.

                    an interactive 4th grade curriculum aimed to teach students about Idaho's history. I drew the website's assets, like this one, 
                    and was in charge of designing the site's colors, fonts, and overall layout.

                <p>
                    This was a rotoscopy animation I made in the fall of 2022 of my dog, Declan. This was done in Adobe
                    Animate and was the first
                    time I used the program. This consists of over 160 frames and took me about two days to complete.
                    One of these days I'd love
                    to continue working on it by adding color or a background.

                <h3>Schrodinger's Cat - Interactive Comic End Animation/Timelapse</h3>
                <p>
                    During my GIMM 250 class in the spring of 2023, I worked on a group project where we were tasked to create an interactive comic
                    on a complex idea, such as quantum physics or how atoms work. Our group was given Schrodinger's Cat as our prompt, and I was 
                    in charge of designing all the characters and lining the storyboards of the comic. This clip in particular is a timelapse of the
                    last animation that plays at the end of the comic that I created, which I'm pretty happy with. This project was super fun to work
                    on, and I learned a lot doing it.
