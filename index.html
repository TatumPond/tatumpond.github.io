                <h3>Island Run - 2D Platformer</h3>
                <p>
                    Island Run is a game that I began designing, developing, and directing during GIMM 110 in the
                    fall of 2022. This game has since been worked on again in the fall of 2023, where I created a game
                    trailer for it,
                    as well as adding a day and night cycle. You play as a dog who's trying to escape a volcanic
                    eruption on a tropical island,
                    while you collect moths and try to reach the end of the level. This was the first time I ever
                    attempted to code or develop any
                    sort of game, so I hold it very near and dear to me. I learned so many new skills and it tested me
                    so much, but I had a really
                    good time making it.

                <h3>Wonderful Wonderful - Fake "The Lion King" Trailer</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a project I did for my GIMM 100 final in the fall of 2022, which was a class centered around
                    2D art and animation. I
                    decided to do my project on The Lion King, one of my favorite Disney movies, and directed it to seem
                    like a trailer for the movie.
                    This was one of the first full projects I did in Clip Studio Paint, and at the time I was still very
                    new to the program, so I
                    learned a lot about what it can do. I really enjoy drawing stylized characters, so I had a great
                    time drawing TLK in my style.

                <h3>Rotoscopy Project</h3>
                <p>
                    This was a rotoscopy animation I made in the fall of 2022 of my dog, Declan. This was done in Adobe
                    Animate and was the first
                    time I used the program. This consists of over 160 frames and took me about two days to complete.
                    One of these days I'd love
                    to continue working on it by adding color or a background.
